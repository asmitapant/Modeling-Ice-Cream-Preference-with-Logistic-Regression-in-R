# Modeling-Ice-Cream-Preference-with-Logistic-Regression-in-R
This project models the probability of someone liking ice cream based on the outdoor temperature using logistic regression. A small dataset is created manually, and a logistic model is fitted using R's glm() function. The predicted probabilities and binary classifications are visualized, and a smooth logistic curve is plotted to reveal the relationship between temperature and preference. This example highlights the concept of binary classification and sigmoid curves for beginners in data science.
Let's discuss the Code:-
Dataset Creation:
Temperature ranges from 10°C to 30°C.
LikesIcecream is binary (0 or 1), assuming warmer temperatures → higher preference.
Model Fitting:
fit a logistic regression using glm() with binomial family to predict LikesIcecream from Temperature.
Prediction:
predict(..., type="response") gives the estimated probabilities from the logistic function.
And classify them into 0 or 1 based on the 0.5 threshold.
Visualization:
The scatterplot shows actual data points.
lines() plots the fitted logistic curve, giving a nice visual of how probability of liking ice cream rises with temperature.
